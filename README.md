HiðŸ‘‹

I'm a math and CS student at UVic and hosting some of my work on this page. 

I built an optimization web app for a one-dimensional stock cutting problems using a mixted integer solver (SCIP), Flask and Bootstrap and deployed it with Docker and Google Cloud Services.

If you'd like to check out :arrow_right: ["The Amazing Lumber Calculator"](https://lumber-calculator-python-kmrqin4jgq-uc.a.run.app/calc) :arrow_left:  you can find it here! 

The source code is in the [lumber-cutter-python repo](https://github.com/mjshehan/lumber-calculator-python)

My other projects were all done as part of my work as a research assistant at the University of Waterloo or my math and CS degree at the University of Victoria:

* [Cognitive Effort Research Poster](https://github.com/mjshehan/cognitive-effort/blob/main/Cog-Sci%20Poster-%20Publisher%20-%201.8.pdf)
* [Python Ray Tracer](https://github.com/mjshehan/ray-tracer-python)
* [Central Limit Theorem Simulations and Visualizaitions]( https://github.com/mjshehan/CLT-simulations-R/blob/main/Z-square-CLT-demo.pdf)

Thanks for checking out my profile!
