HiðŸ‘‹

I'm a math and CS student at UVic and hosting some of my work on this page. 

I built an optimization web app for a one-dimensional stock cutting using a mixted integer solver (SCIP), Flask and Bootstrap and deployed it with Docker and Google Cloud 

If you'd like to check out "The Amazing Lumber Calculator", it's currently deployed at: https://lumber-calculator-python-kmrqin4jgq-uc.a.run.app/calc

The source code is in the lumber-cutter-python repo: https://github.com/mjshehan/lumber-calculator-python

Thanks for checking out my page!
