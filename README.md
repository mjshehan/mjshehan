HiðŸ‘‹

I'm a math and CS student at UVic and hosting some of my work on this page. 

If you'd like to use my one dimensional linear optimizer, "The Amazing Lumber Calculator", it's currently deployed at: https://lumber-calculator-python-kmrqin4jgq-uc.a.run.app/calc
The source code is in the lumber-cutter-python repo

Thanks for checking it out!

-Mike
